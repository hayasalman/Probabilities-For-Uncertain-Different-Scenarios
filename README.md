## Overview

Rolling a Dice gives me a set of outcomes distributed in a particular way , where as the marks of a particular subject of a class gives me another distribution and occurrence of car accidents 
in a particular year follows an entirely different distribution and so on. 
Different Distributions help us to know more about the data and its characteristics. It helps to understand what could be the possible outcome if it follows a particular distribution.

A **probability distribution** simply shows the probabilities of getting different outcomes.

In this repository we will find out the probability distributions for certain events that might happen in today's different businesses.

## About The Dataset

 *All the datasets stored as CSV file and can be accessed through this links :*

- [Addids Sneakers Size Info](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Datasets/adidas_data.csv)
- [Customers Info](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Datasets/clients_data.csv)
- [Logisitcs Companies Info](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Datasets/shipping_companies.csv)

## Coding

  -  Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) : Jupyter Notebooks.

   **Packeges used** 
  * **pandas - numby** : used for data manipulation.
  * **matplotlib - seaborn** : used for data visualtion.
  * **scipy** : used for probability distributions.

## Approches & Methodologies

- Define the event of the interest that we want to find its probability of occurrence.
  
- Select the proper probability distributions:
  
   1. Bernoulli distribution.
   2. Binomial Distribution.
   3. Normal distribution.
   4. Standardize normal distribution.
   5. Discrete uniform distribution.
   6. Continuous uniform distribution.

- Find the probabilities by either using : **Probability Density Function (PDF) or Cumulative distribution function (CDF)**.

- Draw conclusions.

*Lastly , we will infer the population statistic from the sample statistic by: Point Estimate and Confidence Intervals.*

## Business Insights

- In [The Bernoulli Distribution](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Notebooks/Bernoulli%20Vs.%20Binomial%20Distribution.ipynb) , there is a 67% chance that one 
  customer will turn into a buyer and that is what most likely will happen.

- In [The Binomial Distribution](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Notebooks/Bernoulli%20Vs.%20Binomial%20Distribution.ipynb) , there's a zero possibility that the 
  customers who will become buyers will be less than 48 and more than 85 customers.
  In fact , what more likely will happen is the business will end up having approximately  66 buyers.

- In [The Normal Distribution](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Notebooks/Normal%20Distribution.ipynb) , on the average the UK males wear 8.4 size and frankly most 
  of them wear this sneaker size.

- In [The Standardize Normal Distribution](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Notebooks/Normal%20Distribution.ipynb) , before we find out about both customers' z- 
  score statistics, it was hard  to compare between them in term of who spending the most since they use different currencies depend on the country they based at ,
  but now with the z-scores results, we can say that : in terms of the spendings the Australian customer has a higher z-score so he/she is the 1st customer of Adidas.

- In [The Discrete Uniform Distribution](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Notebooks/Uniform%20Distribution.ipynb) , there's 90% chance that the drinks sales is more 
  than 12 per a day.

- In [The Continuous Uniform Distribution](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Notebooks/Uniform%20Distribution.ipynb) , there's 40% chance that the companies shipping 
  days will take less than 3 days.

- In [The Point Estimation](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Notebooks/Point%20Estimation%20%26%20Confidence%20Interval.ipynb) , the estimation of the average 
  amount of damages of structural defect in the buildings is : 192,000 SAR.

- In [The Confidence Intervals](https://github.com/hayasalman/Probability-Distributions/blob/main/Notebooks/Point%20Estimation%20%26%20Confidence%20Interval.ipynb) , 95% of the time , the mean of 
  amount for cups of water dispensed by the new kettle will be between 1.3 L and 1.7 L.
